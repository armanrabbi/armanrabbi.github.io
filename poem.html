		<h1>A City's Death By Fire</h1>
		<p>After that hot gospeller has levelled all but the churched sky,
		I wrote the tale by tallow of a city's death by fire;
		Under a candle's eye, that smoked in tears, I
		Wanted to tell, in more than wax, of faiths that were snapped like wire.
		All day I walked abroad among the rubbled tales,
		Shocked at each wall that stood on the street like a liar;
		Loud was the bird-rocked sky, and all the clouds were bales
		Torn open by looting, and white, in spite of the fire. </p>
		</br></br></br>
